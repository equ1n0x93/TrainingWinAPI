# TrainingWinAPI
WinAPI Training:

Excercise 1:
   - create an executable that creates another a cmd that writes “hi” to a file
   - do the same with a dll with an exported function
   - bonus round: create the process hidden
  coding is strictly C with winapi, i advise using visual studio
  after setting up this should take roughly 4h.
